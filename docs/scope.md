# Project Background and Description

This project was initiated to address the growing demand for online bookstores, identified by the bookstore owner and management team. It aims to provide customers with a convenient platform to browse, purchase, and manage their book collections online. The expected outcome is an efficient and user-friendly bookstore application that enhances customer satisfaction and boosts sales revenue.

# Project Scope

In-scope activities include:
- Implementing a user-friendly interface for browsing books, placing orders, and managing user accounts.
- Integrating with existing book databases to provide users with accurate book information, including titles, authors, descriptions, and prices.
- Implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data and facilitate secure transactions.

Out-of-scope activities:
- Developing new book recommendation algorithms.
- Major revisions to existing backend infrastructure or database schemas not directly related to the application's functionality.

# High-level Requirements

The bookstore application will meet the following high-level requirements:

Functional Requirements:
- User Interface: The application must offer a responsive and intuitive interface for users to browse books, search for specific titles or authors, and place orders seamlessly.
- Book Management: Ability to add, edit, and delete books from the database, with support for various book attributes such as genres, ratings, and reviews.
- User Authentication: Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only registered users can access certain features like placing orders and managing profiles.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: The application should load within 3 seconds for users on a standard internet connection and provide smooth navigation throughout the site.
- Security: Must adhere to industry-standard security practices, such as HTTPS encryption and protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
- Scalability: The application architecture should be scalable to handle increased traffic and book inventory over time.

# Deliverables

The project will deliver the following to impacted agencies, stakeholders, or divisions:
- A fully functional online bookstore application, accessible via web browsers.
- Comprehensive documentation for system administrators and end-users, including user manuals and troubleshooting guides.
- Training materials and sessions for internal staff to ensure smooth adoption and operation of the application.
- Regular project updates and a final report outlining the project's outcome and next steps.
